# ENHANCING-VEHICLE-SAFETY-OBJECT-DETECTION-IN-CARS
In this project, we propose a novel approach for object detection in autonomous vehicles by 
utilizing vision sensors equipped with TensorFlow. The increasing volume of traffic encountered 
by vehicles on a daily basis necessitates the use of advanced technologies to meet safety 
requirements. Therefore, we integrate Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and a multisensor fusion algorithm to enhance the accuracy and reliability of object detection. 
Our approach involves vision sensors, powered by TensorFlow, are employed to detect objects 
and accurately measure their range and azimuth angle. This information, along with data from 
radar sensors, can be transmitted to a fusion center where it can used to perform unified object 
tracking and improve the prediction of current tracks. 
By leveraging TensorFlow's object detection capabilities, we aim to achieve comprehensive and 
accurate detection of objects in the vehicle's surroundings. The integration of ADAS technologies 
further enhances the overall safety and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. Real-time assistance 
and automated functions provided by ADAS contribute to improved situational awareness, 
allowing vehicles to navigate complex traffic scenarios with greater confidence. 
Through the multi-sensor fusion algorithm, we overcome the limitations of individual sensors 
and achieve a more robust and reliable object detection system. The fusion of vision and radar 
data enables us to capitalize on their respective strengths, leading to enhanced object detection 
and tracking accuracy. 
The project's main objective is to enhance the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles by 
utilizing vision sensors with TensorFlow for object detection, alongside ADAS technologies. 
This integrated approach provides vehicles with improved situational awareness, accurate object 
detection, and efficient decision-making capabilities in various traffic scenarios. Ultimately, our 
research aims to contribute to the advancement of autonomous driving technology and its 
widespread adoption in real-world applications
